# Journal Site

This is a journal website made with HTML/CSS/JS and a Flask API using SQLite.

Currently, the site:
- Has a **Flask API** that successfully stores + retrieves entries from a SQLite DB.
- Front end and back end are connected using **AJAX**.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to make an API with Flask
- How to interact with SQLite in Python
- Handling CORS

## 🛣️ Next Steps
- [x] Connect the frontend to the API using `AJAX`
- [x] Replace localStorage with backend DB storage
- [ ] Add user accounts (maybe with MongoDB later)
- [x] Style it up with themes / better UI

You can use the current version [here](https://tanaum.github.io/Journal_Site/) (runs with localStorage).
