# Journal Site

This is a journal website made with HTML/CSS/JS and a Flask API using SQLite.

Currently, the site:
- Uses **localStorage** to store entries (so it works in-browser!).
- Has a **Flask API** that successfully stores + retrieves entries from a SQLite DB.
- Does **not yet** connect the JS frontend to the API (that’s the next step).

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to make an API with Flask
- How to interact with SQLite in Python

## 🛣️ Next Steps
- Connect the frontend to the API using `fetch()`
- Replace localStorage with backend DB storage
- Add user accounts (maybe with MongoDB later)
- Style it up with themes / better UI

You can use the current version [here](https://tanaum.github.io/Journal_Site/) (runs with localStorage).
